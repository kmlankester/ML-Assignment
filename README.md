A python implementation and analysis of machine learning models for predicting the severity of COVID19 cases.

Models used:
* Random Forest Classifier
* K Neighbors Classifier
* Support Vector Machine

Each model was trained using hyperparameter tuning, standardisation, normalisation, and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores.

Data cleaning methods used include one-hot encoding, variance inflation factor, and iterative imputation.
